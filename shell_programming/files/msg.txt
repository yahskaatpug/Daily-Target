How about using the su command?

$ whoami
user1
$ su - user2
Password:
$ whoami
user2
$ exit
logout
If you want to log in as root, there's no need to specify username:

$ whoami
user1
$ su -
Password:
$ whoami
root
$ exit
logout
Generally, you can use sudo to launch a new shell as the user you want; the -u flag lets you specify the username you want:

$ whoami
user1
$ sudo -u user2 zsh
$ whoami
user2

//update vs upgrade

update -it updates the meta data of packages, that is what new versions are available in the market
upgrade - it upgrades the new versions available in my local i.e versions given by update command 

//remove vs purge command

remove will delete files of a packages
purge will remove all the files which were not removed by remove command

//services vs packages

services start automatically when the system boots and packages can be stopped and started by us
systemd - manage services in computer
daemon  - processess or services run in background like audio, webcam and many more(win+r and type servies.msc will give all the servies in computer) 

drivers helps to setup connection between hardware and os so that we can run our services.

restart vs reload

restart - reboot
reload - refresh

How to setup ssh for github

    git add . (Add all)
    git commit -m "Message"
    git push
    git  stash
    git pull
    git stash apply
    git remote -v
    - Rebase(add the feature branch commits on tip of main/master branch)
        - A---B---C  (main)
                \
            D---E---F  (feature-branch)
        - A---B---C---D'---E'---F'  (feature-branch)
    - git merge(create new commit)
        - A---B---C  (main)
                \
            D---E---F  (feature-branch)

        A---B---C---M  (main)
             \     /

Data compression is a technique by which we can make our application light ->> means server can serve the request fast.
